## NavPy: The easiest QC tools for navigation

- SurveyWide Map: for spatial analysis and stastics
- SurveyWide Chart: for line by line QC
- P1 Navigator: for p190 files format check and transformation
- CSV Navigator: for shot by shot QC
- STS Navigator: for sts files extraction

## QcPy: Driving seismic better with Python 

QcPy could be used for RMS analysis, Noise test, Sensitivity normalization, and Trace edit, Fresnel Chart

- Trace Edit toolkits: P2G/ ADS Pro/ Trace Edit Plot
- RMS analysis:  RMS analysis, Noise test, Sensitivity Normalization
- Fresnel Calculation: for estimating the size of Fresnel zone
